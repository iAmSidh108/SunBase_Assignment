## Task 1
This was to call the API and show the data in UI. In the JSON there were two set of data with names clients and data. Both had id; So, I tried matching those id and combining the data. I dont know if that was intended but made sense to me so did it that way. So after combining data it looks something like this:

When you open the scene and press play. The list will be empty. Press Fetch button to fetch data.
There is a text that shows status of data fetching.
Once fetched successfully, Status will show "Data Fetched Successfully" and the list will be populated.
The filter dropDown is on top right , you can choose the filter and data will be updated accordingly.

When you click the list item, a new popup will open up and show more details abot the client.

## Task 2
This task was simple, we had to spawn circles and then draw line and destroy the circles once MouseButton is up.
Here when you play the scene, several balloons will be spawned randomly in the screen and you can press mouse left button and move around. Once you lift the button all the touched balloon get destroyed.
There is a restart button which will load the scene again.
